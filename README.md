### 📄 AI PDF Processing & Chatbot Projects (Beginner)

This repository contains my beginner-level experiments and projects focused on working with PDF files using Python. The main goal of this repository is to learn how to extract useful information from documents, build simple question-answering systems, and understand the basics of chatbot development.

All projects here are part of my learning journey, so the code is simple, exploratory, and focused on understanding concepts rather than being production-ready.
